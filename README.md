## Data Visualization Portfolio Projects
Welcome to my Data Visualization repository. Here you can find my projects with Power BI. In every project I try to learn new skills in using Power BI and DAX along with
enhancing my analytical and business acumen.

## About Me
A passionate data science learner with a keen interest in business analysis through data-driven strategies. I thrive on combining technical expertise with analytical skills to craft intelligent solutions for complex challenges. I strongly believe in optimizing business processes and creating positive impacts by leveraging the power of data. Currently, I am dedicated to expanding my knowledge and skills in data analysis and information-based decision-making.

## Project 1: Human Resource Analysis
In the first attempt to make a dashboard with Power BI, I chose the HR data set related to a company in Brazil. To do this, the analysis was divided into three sections: General, Performance and Employee satisfaction.
In General section, I overviewed the general information about human resource like number of active employees and managers in the company or total of salary or bonus given to employee in 2019. Also, I took a look at the age category balance in that company.
In the following section, Performance, I tried to figure out how performance of employees changed over the time with a descriptive performance column in the dataset which was changed to a numerical column. In addition, I answered this question which age category was the most productive.
In the last section, The reasons for employee turnover and the turnover rate were examined. Finally, The data showed me the effect of annual salary on average satisfaction Index and how this index changed between 2014 and 2019.

## Project 2: Phone Sales Analysis
Working with data gives me the chance to enhance my knowledge in other field. In this analysis I have tried to analyze a sales dataset. Among the many performance indicators in the field of sales, I took "sales increase" (The amount of sales growth or decline compared to the previous period), "Sales productivity" (sales/cost) and profit margin.
When performance indicators are paired with other information valuable insights can be gained. For example, as it is shown below, "Huawei", A brand with the lowest sales volume and the least profitability, had the highest sales productivity and moderate sales increase in 2021. This problem can originate from different sources like "insufficient marketing", "weak branding", "wrong pricing" or other sections.

## Project 3: Marketing Campaign Analysis
The Insights from the dataset:
1) Wine was the product that recorded the highest sales. (50% of Total spend)
2) Totally, people with high income ranage (52000-75000$) spent the most compared to other income categories.
3) Regarding the effect of age, people in (35-50) age range, made the most purchase. (40.6%)
4) Spanish citizens with 662220$ spending, stood at the first rank compared to other countries.
5) The most people preferred doing their purchase at stores.
6) 167 people accepted the offer in campaign 4 which was the most successful campaign.

## Project 4: Super Store Analysis
To Analyze this dataset, I divided the project to 3 sections : Customer, Product and Sales.
* In the customer section, I examined the distribution of customers in the United States. Customers in the West and East recorded higher sales and profitability compared to those in the South and Central regions. Additionally, the highest sales were recorded in New York City. One important point in this section was the decline in the number of customers in 2020, which, as reflected in the sales section, led to a decrease in total sales for that year.
