## Data Visualization Portfolio Projects
Welcome to my Data Visualization repository. Here you can find my projects with Power BI. In every project I try to learn new skills in using Power BI and DAX along with
enhancing my analytical and business acumen.

Currently, I am dedicated to expanding my knowledge and skills in data analysis and information-based decision-making.

## Human Resource Analysis
In the first attempt to make a dashboard with Power BI, I chose the HR data set related to a company in Brazil. To do this, the analysis was divided into three section: General, Performance and Employee satisfaction.
In General section, I overviewed the general information about human resource like number of active employees and managers in the company or total of salary or bonus given to employee in 2019. Also, I took a look at the age category balance in that company.
In the following section, Performance, I tried to figure out how performance of employees changed over the time with a descriptive performance column in the dataset which was changed to a numerical column. In addition, I answered this question which age category was the most productive.
In the last section, The reasons for employee turnover and the turnover rate were examined. Finally, The data showed me the effect of annual salary on average satisfaction Index and how this index changed between 2014 and 2019.
